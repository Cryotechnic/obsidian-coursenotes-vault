# Components 
- Many, if not *most* applications nowadays are ***network-aware***
- *Protocols* are used to implement applications
	- Open-standard: Other vendors can create applications and they can interact with each other
	- Closed-standard (*proprietary*): The protocol(s) will only work with a specific application
	- Example of protocols:
		- *Simple Mail Transfer Protoco* (SMTP)
		- *Internet Access Protocol* version 4 (IMAP4)
		- *Post Office Protocol* 3 (POP3)
		- *File Transfer Protocol* (FTP)
			- Filezilla
		- *HyperText Transfer Protocol* (HTTP) 
			- Edge
			- Firefox
			- Apache
	- Some protocols require very little bandwidth, others a lot
		- E.g. *Voice over IP* (VoIP)
			- *Quality of Service* features are often implemented to ensure:
				-  Bandwidth priority for increased relilability and delay reduction

#### To build a network, three major categories of components must be present:
- Computer components:
	- Responsible for providing applications to users
		- PCs (any OS)
		- File server
- Networking components:
	- Responsible for moving information between computers
		- Hubs
		- Bridges
		- Switches
		- Routers
		- Firewalls
		- Wireless Access Points
		- Modems
		- Network Terminator Type 1 (ISDN)
		- Channel Service Units (CSU)
		- Data Service Units (DSU)
