# Key Characteristics

#### When designing and maintaning a network, the following should be considered:

- Cost:
	- Initial upfront price of network components
	- Installation cost
	- Maintenance cost
- Security:
	- Protection of network components
	- Protection of data house within 
	- Protection of data exchanged between components
- Speed:
	- How fast data is exchanged (*data rate*)
- Topology:
	- Physical cabling layout
	- Logical way data moves between components
- Scalability:
	- How well the structure adapts to new growth
		- New users
		- New applications
		- New network components
- Reliability:
	- Reliability of components
	- Reliability of connection between them
	- **MTBF** (*Mean Time Between Failure*) is the measurement of the likelyhood of a component or resource failing
- Availability:
	- Measures the amount of time that the network is available to the user
	- Measured in **minutes in a given year** (% is made based on minutes)
