![[Pasted image 20220310155937.png]]

- Central device with multiple [[Point-to-Point Topology]] connections to other devices
	- Used in environments where multiple components need to be connected
- When connecting components:
	- Hub / Switch: "Center" of the star
		- If failure, no components can communicate
			- [[Extended Star Topology]] can be used to remedy that problem
				- Extended: Multiple [[Star Topology]] 

Example Media Type: 10BaseT Ethernet (10Mbps => twisted pair => 100m max range) -> 1980s
