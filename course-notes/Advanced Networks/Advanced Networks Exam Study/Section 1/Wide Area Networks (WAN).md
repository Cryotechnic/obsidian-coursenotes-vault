# Wide Area Networks (*WAN*)
- Used to connect [[Local Area Networks (LAN)]] together over **a great distance**
- Typically involves paying recurring monthly fees to a service provider
- Connection Types:
	- Circuit-switched
		- Temporary connection across a phone circuit
			- Analog Dialup
			- ISDN
			- 3G / 4G (LTE) => used for dial-on-demand or backup connections
	- Cell-switched
		- Same features as **Dedicated Connections**
			- Asynchronous Transfer Mode (*ATM*)
		- Switches fixed-length packets (*cells*)
		- Advantage:
			- Single device can connect to multiple devices on the **same interface**
		- Disadvantages:
			- Unavailable in some locations
			- Difficult setup 
			- Difficult maintenance / troubleshooting process
			- Expensive equipment
	- Packet-switched
		- **Similar to Cell-Switched**
			- Frame Relay
			- X.25
		- Switches *variable-length* packets
			- This makes it better suited for data services (they can provide QoS that cell-switched has)
	- Dedicated connection
		- Permanent connection between 2 sites
		- Bandwidth is dedicated to the company's use
- Service Types:
	- Asynchronous Transfer Mode (*ATM*)
	- Digital Subscriber Line (*DSL*)
		- Advantages:
			- Speeds up to few Mbps (25-100)
			- Costs less than other options
		- Disadvantages:
			- Coverage limited to ~18 000 feet
			- Not available in all areas
	- Cable
		- Coaxial copper & fiber
		- Advantages:
			- Higher data rates than Digital Subscriber Line (*DSL*)
			- Full-time connection (Like *DSL*)
		- Disadvantages:
			- Shared service (functions like Ethernet in [[logical bus topology]])
			- More susceptible to security risks (MITM attacks & sniffing)
	- Frame Relay
	- Integrated Service Digital Network (*ISDN*)
	- X.25

#### The difference between a [[Local Area Networks (LAN)]] & a [[Wide Area Networks (WAN)]] is that LANs provide *high-speed* bandwidth connections to interconnect components in a geographically close location vs WANs, which provide *lower-speed* bandwidth connections to interconnect multiple locations / sites.
