# Domains
- Broadcast Domain: 
	- Number of nodes that can listen to a broadcasted message
	- Can be found by looking at the number of ports on a switch (i.e. 8 port switch has a domain of 8)
	- Can be found by looking at the number of ports on a switch - 1 (i.e. 8 port switch has a domain of 7, because they do not consider the sender as a valid port)
	- Creation of VLANs can segregate collision domains
- Collision Domain: 
	- Happens if 2 devices send packets at the same time on the same network
		- Both senders need to resend the packets as both are destroyed
	- CSMA/CD:
		- Stands for Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection
		- Network protocol for carrier transmission
			- Operating in the medium access control layer
			- Interrupts sender broadcast until shared channel is free
			- Collision is detected by broadcast-sensing from other stations
			- Upon collision, transmission is stopped & jam signal is by the sender  to other stations, sender waits a random time interval before retransmission attempt
	- CSMA/CA:
		- Stands for Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Avoidance
		- Network protocol for carrier transmission
		- Nodes only attempt to send data if the shared channel is in 'idle' state
