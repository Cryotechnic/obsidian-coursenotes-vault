# Physical Layer
## Structured Cabling
- Work Area
- Horizontal
- Telecommunication Closet
	- Patch Panel
	- Switch
- Vertical / Backbone cabling
	- Connects different sectors of the network
	- Should be greater than required in each sector
	- Bandwidth measured in bps (bits per second, ***not bytes per second***)
- Server Room / Equipment Room
	- Switches
	- Routers
	- Firewall
	- Server
- Entrance Room
	- Room containing devices that connect to internet / intranet
	- Can be in the same location as the server room (combined)

## Scalability
- Allows expansion
- More ports in switch than computers needed to be connected
