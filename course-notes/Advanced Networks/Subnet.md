## Subnet
- Indicates the range of the operating network
- Structure of subnet mask is similar to IP address
- Default subnet masks:
	- Class A: 255.0.0.0 /8 (11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000)
		- Network: 2^8 (256)
		- Host: 2^24 (16777216)
	- Class B: 255.255.0.0  /16 (11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000)
		- Network: 2^16 (65536)
		- Host: 2^16 (65536)
	- Class C: 255.255.255.0 /24 (11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000)
		- Network: 2^24 (16777216)
		- Host: 2^8 (256)
- Octets that are "1" are considered to be *Network* address
	- __Look at the above representation for examples!__
- Octets that are "0" are considered to be *Host* address
- /8, /16, /24 (subnet mask) delimits how many octets have to be identical to be considered as part of the same network
	- /8 means that the first octet needs to match
	- /16 means that the first 2 octets need to match
	- /24 means that the first 3 octets need to match
	- If this condition is not true, then they do belong on the same network
