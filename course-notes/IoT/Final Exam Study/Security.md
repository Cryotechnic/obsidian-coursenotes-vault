# IoT Security
- Our data considered resource
	- Valuable as means of payment for overcoming business challenges

## Information Security Domain
***Threat***: Natural or manmade circumstance that could have a bad impact on organizational asset
***Vulnerability***: Absence / weakness in safeguard(s) that make a threat more likely to occur
***Asset***: Resource, process, product or system that has some value to organization and must be protected

### $Threat * Vulnerability = Risk$
## Risk Management Importance
- Identification
	- Asset Valuation
- Analysis
	- Threat Analysis
	- Risk analysis (Quantitative & Qualitative)
- Control
	- Reduction
	- Assignment
	- Acceptance

## Security Domains
- Information Security (InfoSec)
	- Protecting information systems from unauthorized access
- Cybersecurity (CyberSec)
	- Protect the use of cyberspace from cyberattacks
- IT Security (ITSec)
	- Cybersecurity strategies that prevents unauthorized access to assets

## Information Security Pillars
- Confidentiality: Protection of information from unauthorized access
- Integrity: Information is kept accurate and consistent unless authorized changes are made
- Availability: Situation where information available when and where needed

Aspects of InfoSec:
- Physical Security
- User Security
- Network Security
- Data Security
- Operating System Security
- Application Security

## IoT Security 
- IoT can use cybersecurity techniques but they need more:
	- Devices are typically low-cost end nodes with little to 0 budget for security
	- Devices will have resource constraints that can lead to vulnerabilities
	- IoT devices are usually more accessible than traditional IT equipment
	- Diversity of internal components make it difficult for manufacturers to implement 1 standard for security
	- Devices are deployed for multi-year/multi-decade use, thus prologing the exposure to attacks and exposing them to new attack vectors

### Cybersecurity Framework
- Set of standards and best practices to help organizations manage cybersecurity risk
