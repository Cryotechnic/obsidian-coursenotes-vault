- Element placement in the frame is important
	- Content isn't everything
- Symmetry gives a sense of balance & order
- #### Rule of Thirds
	- Grid that acts like a guide for aligning elements of the frame
	- Composition if built into units of 3
		- Foreground
		- Background
		- etc. 
	- The eyes should be on the top
		- You can make the eyes appear in the middle or at the bottom, as a creative decision
- ### Compositional Stress
	- Imbalance that can communicate many things
		- Weak, different, tension, premonition that something is wrong
	- ### Eye Room / Looking Room
	- ### Negative Space
		- Expectation that something will come to "restore the balance"
	- ### Deep Space Composition 
	- ### Deep Focus Composition
	- ### Shallow Focus Composition
